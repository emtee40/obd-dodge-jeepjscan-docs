Dodge RAM


Modules
=======
The modules section of the app gives access to actual control modules of the vehicle, live data provided by them and module-specific Activations.

.. note:: Activation is a "live" change that will **NOT** be stored after vehicle restart.



Adaptations
===========
The Adaptation section allows making changes to various settings in the ECU.
.. note:: Adaptations are permanent.


Disabling TPMS
--------------

Dodge RAM: After disabling TPMS you need to re-initialize Radio Frequency Hub, which requires vehicle PIN. And this is to be tested.
