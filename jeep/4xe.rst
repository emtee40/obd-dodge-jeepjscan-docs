Tire size
===============================
When changing tire size in a JL 4xe, you need to run ABS Initialization procedure. ABS Static Init (Hybrid) should be used.

Gear ratio
===============================
The 4xe **will not work** with axle ratios **higher than 4.50**. There is no currently known workaround to this limit.
