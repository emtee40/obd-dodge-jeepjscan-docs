Tire size
===============================
When changing tire size in a JL 4xe, you need to run ABS Initialization procedure. ABS Static Init (Hybrid) should be used.

Follow these steps:
1) Set ignition to "RUN" and make sure "READY" info is not visible on Instrument Cluster, connect as usual (with the SGW bypass cable).
2) Go to Tire Size adaptation and chose desired tire size.
3) Hit "GO" and wait till adaptation is complete.
4) When adaptation says completed **don't start the car**.
5) Run the **ABS Static Initialize (Hybrid)** procedure.
6) When done, set ignition to "OFF", then open and close driver door.
7) Wait till instrument cluster shuts down.
8) Start the car.

Gear ratio
===============================
The 4xe **will not work** with axle ratios **higher than 4.50**. There is no currently known workaround to this limit.
