Tire Size
---------

.. note:: In models equipped with the advanced Park Sense module (not the basic, 4-sensor one) setting a bigger tire size **will cause Park Sense and ABS errors** and there is currently no known solution.

Generally, follow the default `Tire Size`_ procedure, and then:

	- if everything works fine after you restart the car, you're good to go
	- if you are getting an ABS error:
		- Run **ABS Initialization** adaptation
		- Run Advanced Scan and clear the error codes
		- Cycle the ignition (shut the car down, wait a moment, start it again)


SRT Mode vs Performance Pages
-----------------------------

If you want to enable SRT / Performance Pages on the radio, **don't use SRT Mode Adaptation.** This adaptation is used if you actually have an SRT hardware. To enable SRT options on the radio use Performance Pages adaptation, and be aware that the radio might need up to 24 hrs to catch up on changes made and/or a hard reset (pulling the radio fuse) if 24 hrs wait is not enough.
