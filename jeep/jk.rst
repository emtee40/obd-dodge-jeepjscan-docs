Installing LED Fog Lights
-------------------------

JScan can't help much here, but please see this great guide on installing LED `fog lights`_ in your JK.

US -> EU Light conversion
-------------------------

If you imported a JK from the USA, you will need to adapt (among other things) the rear lights. In American version the stop light is also the turn signal. In Europe, these need to be separated.

1. `Connect`_ to your vehicle
2. Open Adaptation
3. Open "Lights conversion US<->EURO & LED"
4. Set "Rear Lighting Combined On/Off" to **disabled**

Now your side lamps will work as indicators only, and you need to route a wire from the third (central) stop light to each of the rear lamps to power the European stop lights as well.


Transmission gear ratio
-------------------------

Change this *only* if you physically changed the gears. Make sure you know the actual ratio (don't trust the labels on boxes).
	
1. `Connect`_ to your vehicle
2. Open Adaptation
3. Open "Tire & Axle Settings"
4. Change T-Case High and/or T-Case Low Ratio
5. Execute Initialize EGS

	.. note:: For WA580 - NAG1 automatic transmission only. This step is *not* required in JK 3.8 with an older transmission (it doesn't have the EGS).

6. Turn off the vehicle
7. Close & lock the door and leave the vehicle for a 15 min break
8. Go for a test drive
	
.. note:: If there are errors mentioning "incorrect gear ratio" see `Troubleshooting`_
