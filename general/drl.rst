A daytime running lamp (DRL, also daytime running light) is an automotive lighting on the front of a roadgoing vehicle, automatically switched on when the vehicle’s handbrake has been pulled down and is in drive, emitting white, yellow, or amber light. Their job is not to help the driver see the road but to help other road users see the vehicle.
