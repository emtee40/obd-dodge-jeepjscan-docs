Advanced Scan
=============

Allows a more detailed look into any errors reported by the vehicle.

Returns errors and allows clearing them (tap the trash can icon).

.. note:: Advanced Scan and code clearing does NOT solve the reason why errors occur.

There are different error statuses, two of them being the most frequent (status is written jut below the error code):

- **stored:** the error occurred in the past and usually is not present anymore. In most cases, this type of error will be permanently deleted when you clear error codes
- **active:** the error is currently reported by the car. In most cases, this error will come back after clearing error codes
