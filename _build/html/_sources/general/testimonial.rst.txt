FYI, I received my by pass cable and I was able to read my 2019 1500 with out any issues. My tire size is now correct and I'm back on track. Thanks for the info and thanks for be very easy on the wallet, most programmers are much more expensive. I also love the simplicity of how OBDII JScan works, it is very user friendly.
